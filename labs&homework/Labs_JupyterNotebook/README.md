# Labs_JupyterNotebook

One can find all the **Practice Labs** of each week in this folder. The contributor chose to supply the _original version_ of the files downloaded from the course homepage, which means there is _no code_ in the `#Todo` sections and one cloning this repository to his/her computer is allowed to practice himself/herself. 

Do not be afraid of unable to complete the practice labs and pass the tests. There are hints folded right below the `#Todo` sections, and one is allowed to view the tips to get through the difficult parts.

It is recommended to create a new env with `python==3.8.16` and `tensorflow==2.11.0`. The versions of packages used in the labs can be found in **requirements.txt**, and one can install them in the created python env.
